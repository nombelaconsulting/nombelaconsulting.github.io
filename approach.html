  <h2>How We Work</h2>
  <p>
    We engage with clients on a project, retainer, or interim basis, offering
    senior-level advisory support without the overhead of a full-time hire.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our approach is collaborative, context-driven, and grounded in international
    standards while remaining sensitive to local realities.
  </p>

  <p>
    We work remotely where appropriate and partner with trusted local and
    international institutions when scale or specialisation is required.
